What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initialize a repository git creates the necessary hidden folders to track the meta data of the repository folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a place we add files that will be tracked. The working directory is the local directory that stores all files regardless of tracking status. Upon comitt the repostiory stores all files and thier history.
