When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you would like to colaborate with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

pulling a file automatically may adversly effect the project by causing errors in other files.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks allow us to make copies of other peoples repository so that we can change the contents of the repos without affecting the original repo. Clones allow us to make copies of our own repositories. Branches allow us to add experimental features to our repository without affecting the production version of the project.
