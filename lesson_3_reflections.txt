When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you would like to colaborate with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

pulling a file automatically may adversly effect the project by causing errors in other files.
